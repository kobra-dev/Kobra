# Contributing Guidelines

tldr: fork the repo, and then PR with changes. be sure to link an issue with the PR and give a decent description. also, please test for bugs before you PR. Thanks so much for contributing :)

Fork/Branch -> Main Branch -> Testing Environment -> Production Environment

Fork/Branch - Fork the repo or create a branch if i made u a collaborator (email me at pranavnt@outlook.com if you want me to make you a collaborator), and make all your changes there.

Main Branch - PR with a good description and make sure pranavnt is a reviewer for frontend work and abstractultra is a reviewer for backend work.

Testing Environment - Once we are solely focused on bug testing, we'll deploy to https://kobra.netlify.app for bug testing

Production Environment - https://kobra.dev
