We use the Business Source License because we value open source but also want to ensure we have a sustainable business model.

We have the change date set really far in the future to rely on the fourth anniversary date built into the license instead of the change date parameter.

**For the purposes of the license, each individual commit pushed to the GitHub repository is a new version of the software.**
